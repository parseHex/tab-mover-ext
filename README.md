# Tab Mover

A simple extension that makes it easier to move tabs around a window.

You can either click the extension's icon for a popup menu or right click anywhere on a page for a menu wherever you are. You can move the current tab:

- To the far left/beginning of the tab list
- To the left by 1
- To the right by 1
- To the far right/end of the tab list

## Motivation

When you're dragging to rearrange tabs, it's pretty easy to accidentally move the cursor down to far and cause the tab to "break away" into a new window. If you have Chrome in fullscreen mode on Mac this is especially inconvenient because you have to un-fullscreen both windows, move the tab back to the correct window and re-fullscreen the window.

## Building

As of the time of writing, there isn't a need for module bundling or anything fancy. You can run the `build` script to get a `.zip` built to the `builds/` directory.
